As a coffee lover, I understand the joy and energy that coffee brings to our day, and for many, it's an essential part of their routine. With this passion in mind, I've undertaken an exciting project as a Business Data Analyst for "Aroma Junction," a coffee shop chain with three locations. Through a detailed sales data analysis, I've uncovered valuable insights to help the business owners understand market behavior, identify trends, and discover growth opportunities. By focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), I've created an insightful interactive dashboard that presents these insights in a clear and actionable way. The entire project, along with supporting documents, is available on GitHub. I have taken a help from Data Studio.
